<h1>Our Goals</h1>
<p>My short-term goal is to complete my Bachelor of Political Science and commission as an Army 2ND Lieutenant. I want to be an officer to inspire other naturalized Americans like myself to believe in their dreams. I strongly believe that representation matters and would like to prove to everyone out there that the American dream is still very much alive as long as you are ready to put in the work. My long-term goal is to become a public servant, proudly representing and serving the interests of the people of Texas.</p>

<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Lomé, Togo (West Africa) where I graduated High School in September 2012. I have attended The University of Lome where I completed an Associate Degree in 2015. Seeking for better opportunities and reuniting with my family I immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2016. I then enlisted in the United States Army and graduated Basic Combat Training in June 2020 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. </p>

<h1>What We Have Accomplished</h1>
<p>August 2020, I received orders to my first duty station Fort Hood, TX and was assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment. In September 2020, I deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this year tour I served as the battery’s CBRN Specialist and Orderly Room Clerk. I assisted the battery with proper CBRN training, accountability of CBRN equipment, I processed over 200 HR actions, to include emergency leaves, pay inquiry, post deployment leave for the entire unit, and over 20 Basic Leaders Course packets. Upon completion of this tour, I received two Army Achievement Medals, one Overseas Service Ribbon and one Army Commendation Medal. </p>
